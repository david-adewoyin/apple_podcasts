It was a night that shocked the country with its brutality—and its mystery. Who would commit such horrible crimes? And why? Ohio native David Raterman, a longtime journalist and former author for National Geographic, spent 18 months researching this, interviewing Rhoden survivors and friends as well as hundreds of others in the small community. He even spoke with prosecutors and police officers who were officially gagged by the judge, visited the crime scenes countless times, and pored through records at courthouses throughout the region. Two and a half years after the Rhoden murders, investigators suddenly arrested six members of another family. Raterman attended more than 20 of their hearings at the small, one-room courthouse in Pike County and interviewed their neighbors and friends. What he discovered about that family, who owns the most land in the county as well as an elite horse farm, will leave listeners in utter disbelief. And what he reports overall will surprise investigators—as well as true crime listeners who think they’ve heard it all. Presented by Cavalry Audio and iHeartPodcasts"

I find myself saying the same things over and over in my office, realizing that I could have a greater impact if I started reaching the masses. We are all unique in how our bodies respond and react, but there are many basic principles that hold true for everyone. I want to share that knowledge with you. I’m passionate about helping you understand what is normal and natural and what is cause for concern.""She explains that the purpose of her podcast will be to bring you the latest information from the world of wellness and functional medicine because they are at the forefront of science, studying the microbiome, environmental toxicology, nutrition, and epigenetics. She will be covering many topics and explaining women's normal phases of life (puberty, the menstrual cycle, the reproductive years, perimenopause, and postmenopause.) She will discuss how our diets, lifestyle choices, and environment affect our hormones and contribute to disease. Some topics will be hormone imbalance, stress management, weight gain, polycystic ovarian syndrome, endometriosis, the effects of hormonal birth control, pelvic floor issues, nutrition, intermittent fasting, exercise, thyroid disease, depression and anxiety, infertility, and pregnancy.

Penny has been where you are and understands the hurdles blocking your way to successful parenting. Gain the ability to understand and change your child’s behavior, reduce your own stress, increase parenting confidence, and create more successes and joy in your family by learning how to break through your child’s ADHD challenges and your family’s daily struggles. Penny keeps it real, and will be the first to tell you: there’s no magic bullet for ADHD. Some struggles are inevitable, but there’s so much room for improvement, a better life, and a happier family. During the podcast, we talk about: positive parenting strategies, ADHD tools and gadgets, calming activities, homework strategies, advocating at school, perseveration, learning disabilities, medication, therapy, coaching and guidance, learning challenges, giftedness, twice-exceptional traits, Asperger’s, sensory processing disorder, and everything that works (and doesn‘t work) to help you transform your child with ADHD, and your family."

Season Two, presented by C13Originals, in association with The HISTORY® Channel, will guide you through the Battle of Gettysburg and its impact on the future of the country, the relationship between FDR and Churchill and America’s slow walk to war, the plan for AIDS relief, the sinking of the Lusitania and events impact on the future of America, and Bloody Sunday and the Voting Rights Act. This follows Season One which covered the 1918 Flu Pandemic, the Great Depression, World War II, the polio epidemic and the Cuban Missile Crisis. These stories of crisis—the term originates in the writings of Hippocrates, as a moment in the course of a disease where a patient either lives or dies—are rich, and in our own 2021 hour of coming out of the devastating pandemic and slow-motion but indisputably real panic, there’s utility in re-engaging with the stories of how leaders and citizens have reacted amid tension and tumult. The vicissitudes of history always challenge us in new and often-confounding ways; that’s in the nature of things. Still, as Winston Churchill once remarked, “The future is unknowable, but the past should give us hope”—the hope that human ingenuity, reason, and character can combine to save us from the abyss and keep us on a path, in another phrase of Churchill’s, to broad, sun-lit uplands."

After four years of hellish trench warfare, shell fire, 10 million combat deaths, and another 10 million civilian deaths, the world that emerged in 1918 was irrevocably changed. Nation-states came out of the rubble, along with a push for universal rights. New technologies emerged, such as tanks and fighter planes. But something was lost permanently in the Great War: a sense of optimism in mankind.
